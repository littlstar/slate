### HTTP Request

`GET <%= current_page.data.api_url %>/photos/:id`

<aside class="notice">
A request for a photo that is processing, deleted, or currently hidden will result in a 403 error response with an appropriate error message. However, if the photo is **hidden** and the current request has been authenticated by sending an X-Apikey header and the user requesting the photo is the creator of the photo, that photo's details will be returned.
</aside>

<aside class="notice">
When authenticated with an X-Apikey header two additional properties, `stared` and `downvoted`, will be included in each of the photo objects in the array indicating whether the currently authenticated user has stared or downvoted that photo.
