A request for a channel that is currently hidden will result in a 403 error response with an appropriate error message.

When authenticated with an X-Apikey header two additional properties, `stared` and `downvoted`, will be included in each of the video objects in the array indicating whether the currently authenticated user has stared or downvoted that video.
