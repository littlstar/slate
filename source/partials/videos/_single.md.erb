`GET <%= current_page.data.api_url %>/videos/:id`

<aside class="notice">
A request for a video that is encoding, deleted, failed or currently hidden will result in a 403 error response with an appropriate error message. However, if the video is **hidden** and the current request has been authenticated by sending an X-Apikey header and the user requesting the video is the creator of the video, that video's details will be returned.
</aside>

<aside class="notice">
When authenticated with an X-Apikey header an additional property, `stared`, will be included in each of the video objects in the array indicating whether the currently authenticated user has stared that video.

<aside class="notice">
The "download" version will only be returned if the video owner has enabled downloads.
