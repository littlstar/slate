# Introduction

### Welcome to the official Littlstar V1 API documentation!

The following sections describe the features and functionality currently supported by our RESTful API. V1 of the Littlstar API is currently in an **alpha** state, and as such all users should expect rapid changes and frequent breaks of backward compatibility.

If you come across any errors or bugs that you think we should know about, or if you'd just like to reach out and let us know how we're doing and what you'd like to see added and/or improved, please <a href="mailto:support@littlstar.com?subject=API%20Feedback">contact us directly</a>.
